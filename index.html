      <h1>Lets get started!</h1>
      <p>30 is fast approaching but I've always been old for my age anyway. I try my best to split my life in a healthy balance of work and family. I spend my days as a high end retail store manager in the wedding industry. When I am not dealing with brides and their mothers I can usually be found standing next to my girlfriend or slid up next to my family at a local hangout.>
      </p>
      <h1>Kansas City</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in the suburbs of Kansas City, I've lived here for most of all of my life with the exception of a frigid couple years in the north. </p>
      <h1>Things that hold my interest</h1>
      <p>I know a lot of things about a lot of things but never enough about any one of them. To say my hobbies are eclectic is probably an understatement. Many things have sparked my interest and sent me ravenously tearing into everything I could find on the subject. The things that have stuck hard are pretty much anything with an engine and anything mechanical. I love everything from film photography to motorcycles. </p>
      <h1>The future</h1>
      <p>I started working in my uncles sheet metal shop 13 and grew up facinated by the capacity all around me. Whether it was what a new machine was capable of or what I could learn to do, I never passed on the chance to here a story or push those boundaries. My dream job would have to be something that would let me chase things that interest me and allows me to push boundaries.</p>
      <h1>Moving time!!!</h1>
      <p>Our place is nice and our life is great but the change will be welcome! My girlfriend and I are moving out of this apartment and the funky hallway smells to a house with a yard for the dogs to run!</p>
      <h1>Why </h1>
      <p>Opportunity is great and I appreciate the confidence in my abilities from my current employer I am ready to get back to producing again. It may not be cold hard steel but I am fascinated by this transition and the possibilities.</p>
